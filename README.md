**Description (of the board game version):**

- The game board consists of a blank, numbered honeycomb pattern representing a petri dish.

- Each player represents a different bacterium (everyone picks a color).

**Objective:**

- The bacterium with the most points when time is up or there are fewer spots than players wins.
  - If time is up, finish the round before declaring a winner.
  
- 1 contact = 1 point
  - Ex: Green colonizes hexagons 4 and 13 this round. Green scores 5 points because 5 contacts between its colonies are made.

**Game play:**
- Rounds are played as follows:

  a. 1 round = everone takes a turn, game play progresses counterclockwise.
  
  b. Rounds 1-10: Everyone writes down the numbers of 3 hexagons before the round begins:
    - 2 for where they want their bacterium to grow a colony.
    - 1 for where they are secretly placing their antibiotic.
    
  c. Rounds 11+: Antibiotics are no longer allowed. Only 2 colony spots are chosen.
  
  d. Each player's turn = reading their 2 proposed colony numbers and coloring them in *if they are not blocked by someone else.* (Don't say your antibiotic location during your turn.)
  
    - Ways you can be blocked:
    
      a. If you have also chosen the same spot someone else is trying to colonize, say "COMPETITION" immediately.
        - The scorekeeper colors the spot black, and it is permanently out of play.
        
      b. If you have chosen someone's proposed colony spot as your antibiotic location, say "NOPE" immediately.
      
        - The spot cannot be claimed this round.
        
        - **Antibiotics trump "competitions."**
        
          - If multiple players choose the same spot to colonize during a round **and** an antibiotic is there, the spot remains in play for future rounds.
          
    - If you don't say anything until after their turn, you have missed your chance to block.
    
- The scorekeeper marks connections with black lines, writes down scores every turn, and keeps track of running totals.

- The scorekeeper starts the first round. In each successive round, the player who starts the round shifts one player counterclockwise.
